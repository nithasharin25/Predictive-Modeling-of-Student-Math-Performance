# Predictive-Modeling-of-Student-Math-Performance
A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts whether a student will pass or fail in math based on their academic and background information. Built using Python and Decision Tree Classifier in Google Colab.
It takes into account factors like:

Gender

Race/Ethnicity

Parental Level of Education

Lunch Type

Test Preparation Course

Reading Score

Writing Score

The model is trained using the Students Performance dataset, and it helps determine the likelihood of a student passing math with a confidence score.
